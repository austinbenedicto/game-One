# game-One
This is the first game that I am going to to produce. IT is a textbased rogelike game where you run through a dungeon discovering items and other things trying to beat the boss at the end.

All of the details of the game are getting figured out with how it will play and anything of the sort. This game is written in java but will then later be made in C# inside of Unity so that it can be more polished.
